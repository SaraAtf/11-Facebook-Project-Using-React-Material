This project is a minimal setup to get React working with Vite, including Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules.

## Features

- **Fast Refresh**: Instant feedback on edits with HMR.
- **ESLint**: Pre-configured ESLint rules for code quality and consistency.

## Plugins

- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.
